             <h1>Project</h1>
             <p>Premier Website is a responsive web application designed to deliver a clean, modern user experience. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the project demonstrates strong fundamentals in layout design, interactive components, and mobile‑first responsiveness. The site features structured sections for services, projects, and contact information, showcasing both aesthetic design and functional usability. Through this project, I focused on applying semantic HTML, Flexbox/Grid for layouts, and form handling to create a professional, portfolio‑ready website.</p>
